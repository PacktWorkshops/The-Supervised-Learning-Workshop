## About The Data Visualization Workshop
You already know you want to understand supervised learning, and a smarter way to do that is to learn by doing. [The Supervised Learning Workshop](https://courses.packtpub.com/courses/supervised-learning?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781800209046&utm_term=Supervised%20Learning&utm_content=The%20Supervised%20Learning%20Workshop) focuses on building up your practical skills so that you can deploy and build solutions that leverage key supervised learning algorithms. You'll learn from real examples that lead to real results. 

## What you will learn
* Get to grips with the fundamental of supervised learning algorithms
* Discover how to use Python libraries for supervised learning
* Learn how to load dataset in pandas for testing
* Use different types of plots to visually represent the data
* Distinguish between regression and classification problems
* Learn how to perform classification using K-NN and decision trees
